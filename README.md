# crandalf: No More "YOU SHALL NOT PASS"

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yihui/crandalf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yihui/crandalf)

There are a lot of things to check before you submit an R package to CRAN, and
the last thing is probably to make sure your new version will not break any
existing packages on CRAN, otherwise you may have to recall what [Gandalf
said](http://youtu.be/V4UfAL9f74I).

Checking reverse dependencies is certainly not a pleasant thing to do. The basic
idea is extremely simple: you just download all your reverse dependencies and
run `R CMD check` on them. It is fairly easy to automate this, e.g. using
`tools::package_dependencies()`. The code below shows how many packages one may
have to check before submitting a new version to CRAN: 

```r
options(repos = c(CRAN = 'http://cran.rstudio.com'))
db = available.packages()
pkgs = rownames(db)
deps = tools::package_dependencies(pkgs, db, which = 'all', reverse = TRUE)
len  = sapply(deps, length)
tail(sort(len), 10)  # the top 10
#  knitr     plyr survival     Rcpp  mvtnorm   Matrix  ggplot2 testthat  lattice     MASS
#    241      256      273      280      295      314      338      338      421      844
```

## The challenges

However, devils are in the details (as always). The biggest challenge, in my
opinion, is the external system dependencies of some R packages. Reverse
dependency checking will be too simple if the reverse dependencies are pure R
packages. Apparently this is not true, e.g. to install the **XML** package, you
will need `libxml2-dev`. Unforutately there is no official way to formally
specify such dependencies; the closest thing is the `SystemRequirements` field
in package `DESCRIPTION`, which is fairly "loose", and normally you cannot
automatically figure out what packages to install. The manual process is the
pain here. To make things worse, some system packages may not be available in
your system. You may have to find some PPA's to install them. There are other
details that you may need to take care of, such as LaTeX packages (some package
vignettes use uncommon packages that are not included in a "minimal" LaTeX
installation so you may have to install a gigantic Debian package just to check
these packages).

Well, not everyone needs to face the above pain. I feel both honored and painful
as the author of **knitr**: on one hand, I certainly love people making use of
my work; on the other, I have to figure out how to install and check
packages like **RcppOctave** even though I never use them (sorry, Renaud, no
offence, just an example).

For many package authors, this crandalf repository can be useful and simple to
use, and I will explain the simple way and the complicated way, respectively.
Note the packages are checked on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org), so you do
not really need to install anything locally.

## Packages with a small number of reverse dependencies

If your package is not as popular as **MASS**, **testthat**, or **ggplot2**, all
you need to do when you are ready to check your reverse dependencies is submit a
pull request with a special GIT commit message of the form `[crandalf
pkg@repo]`, where `pkg` is the name of your package, and `repo` is your Github
repo. For example, the commit message `aloha, [crandalf highr@yihui/highr]` will
trigger the checking of reverse dependencies of the **highr** package, which
will be installed using `devtools::install_github('yihui/highr')`. At the
moment, only Github is supported. So you fork this crandalf repo, make some
changes, commit with the message containing `[crandalf pkg@repo]`, and submit a
pull request. If you have multiple commits, make sure the message `[crandalf
pkg@repo]` is included in the _last_ commit.

I do not even need to merge your pull request -- the whole point of submitting
the pull request is to trigger the Travis CI service. You do not really need to
make any substantial changes in your pull request, either. You are welcome to
change anything in this repo, such as correcting typos, or improve things. If
you cannot think of anything to do, you can add pictures of kittens to this repo
([@RCatLadies](https://twitter.com/RCatLadies)) if you want...

## Oh, I have a package on which hundreds of package depend

First, congratulations!

In that case, you are likely to split your reverse dependencies into groups,
because Travis CI has the time limit of 50 minutes per job. However, it does not
have a limit on how many jobs in a build matrix you can submit each time.
Therefore, if you have 100 packages to check, you may group them in 10 jobs,
each job checking 10 packages.

You will have to add your package to the file <inst/config/PACKAGES>. There have
been some examples in this file. Let me explain the **knitr** configuration:

```dcf
package: knitr
install: yihui/knitr
matrix: 30
only:
exclude: localsolver tabplot
separate: dbmss | DLMtool | hot.deck | HiveR pkgmaker
sysdeps:
```

The `install` field specifies the Github repo; `matrix` specifies how many jobs
you want to arrange in a Travis build matrix; `only` is useful when you check a
subset of packages: you can specify these packages names in this field,
otherwise all reverse dependencies are checked; `exclude` will exclude some
packages (usually known broken); `separate` can be used to separate a few
packages so they are checked in separate jobs (usually these are the very
time-consuming ones); you can include some system commands in the `sysdeps`
field to, for example, install additional system packages before checking
reverse dependencies. All of these fields are optional except `package` and
`install`.

You need to submit a pull request to get your changes in the `PACKAGES` file
merged. Then I will create a branch of the form `pkg/name`, where `name` is your
package name. The reason for the new branches is that I will have to arrange
packages in `.travis.yml`. You can take a look at
[.travis.yml](https://github.com/yihui/crandalf/blob/pkg/knitr/.travis.yml) in
the `pkg/knitr` branch to understand what I mean here. That `.travis.yml` file
was [automatically](Makefile) generated using the information in `PACKAGES`, and
the `.travis.yml` in the master branch is used as a template.

When you find certain packages cannot be installed due to missing system
dependencies, you can add these dependencies in the
[RECIPES](inst/config/RECIPES) file. Note the latest versions of TeXLive and
Pandoc were pre-installed from the
[ubuntu-bin](https://github.com/yihui/ubuntu-bin) repo. In case you find missing
LaTeX packages, you can either do `tlmgr install` in the `sysdeps` field, or let
me know so I can bundle them in the ubuntu-bin repo. Normally there is no need
to install Gigabytes of `texlive-*` packages. Please do note all the settings
here are tailored for Travis CI, and I do not mean you should do the same thing
for your local computers.

## Want to contribute?

Sure. I absolutely hate figuring out the system dependencies of R packages one
by one. Please do help me expand the `RECIPES` file so more R package authors
can benefit from it.

I can talk endlessly about the pain in this project, such as the broken R
packages in the Ubuntu repo (built before R 3.0.0), the gory details of missing
LaTeX packages, and so on, but that may be meaningless to you. There are also a
few cool features that I do not have time to introduce, and I will see if other
users find this repo useful.

May Gandalf bless CRAN!
